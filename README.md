# Intrusiuon-Detection-System
Developed a host Role-Based Access Control Intrusion Detection System using Sequential Pattern Mining to increase the security of databases. An apriori algorithm was used for the same.

## Objective
This project tries to:
- enforce Intrusion Detection in Bank database using Role-Based Access Control
- extract association rules from the database transaction logs.
- detect insider attacks in the system using Host-Based Intrusion Detection methods and tools.

## Software Requirements
The following software requirements are a must for this project:
1. Eclipse IDE â€“ 4.3 Kepler/ 4.4 Luna/ 4.5 Mars
2. Oracle 10g Express Edition
3. Java version 1.7 or above
4. TGSQL (General Query Parser Library)

## Results
The given approach gives a high precision value of 0.87 and a high recall value of 0.83
